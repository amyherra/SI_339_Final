            <h2>My UX Journey!</h2>
            <p>I love art and all things related to Jean-Michel Basquiat, he is my creative muse!
                I recently joined the University of Michigan community, in the Fall of 2022. I initially started my educational journey at Michigan State University, where I was pursing a nursing degree. However, during a honors anatomy class for pre-health students, I couldn't help but think about my favorite artist, Jean-Michel Basquiat. The images and illustrations in class reminded me of his art which is characterized by brilliant utilization of human anatomy. Basquiat was seven years old when he was hit by a car while playing outside his home, he was rushed to the hospital and during this time his mother gave him a copy of "Gray's Anatomy" which sparked his lifelong interest in the structures and functions of the human body. This led him to develop a visual language that used human anatomy to comment on power, race, identity, and vulnerability. I shortly realized I wanted to follow in his steps and pursue something I loved. At Michigan State University I continued to take classes in Engineering, Biology, Chemistry, Human Anatomy and English Literature. I explored all possible careers my first few years of college and landed on applying to the University of Michigan.

            <h2>Transferring Schools, MSU --> UM!!</h2>
            <p>I was originally a pre-nursing major at Michigan State University, I was unhappy in my studies. I told myself I would follow my passions of creativity and low and behold I was accepted into the University of Michigan School of Information!
            Being a creative individual has helped me hone my problem-solving, technical, and communicative skills – arguably more than any STEM class ever has. Technical classes have provided me with frameworks, algorithms, and coding experience, but it’s always been my creative edge that has enabled me to transform these skills into actionable building blocks to solve problems. It helps me communicate complicated ideas, break down large tasks, and continue seeing potential in a field that is often siloed and binary.</p>
